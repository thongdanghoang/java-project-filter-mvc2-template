# Java Project Filter MVC2 Template

This is a template project for building Java web applications using the MVC2 (Model-View-Controller version 2) architectural pattern with the Java Servlet API (javax.servlet). It provides a basic structure and implementation for creating web applications with clear separation of concerns and modularity.

## Features

- Follows the MVC2 architectural pattern
- Utilizes Java Servlet API for handling HTTP requests and responses
- Provides a simple template for creating web applications
- Offers a clean separation of concerns for easy maintenance and scalability

## Requirements

To use this template project, you need the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above
- An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans
- Apache Maven (optional but recommended for dependency management)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Java Project Filter MVC2 Template:

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Import the project into your preferred IDE as a Maven project.
3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are resolved (if using Maven).
4. Build the project to compile the source code.
5. Deploy the project to a compatible Java web server (e.g., Apache Tomcat, Jetty).
6. Access the web application through the provided URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080/).

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard directory structure commonly used in Java web applications:

- `src/main/java`: Contains the Java source code.
  - `com.example.controller`: Contains the controller classes responsible for handling HTTP requests and controlling the flow of data.
  - `com.example.model`: Contains the model classes representing the data and business logic.
  - `com.example.view`: Contains the view classes responsible for rendering the user interface.
- `src/main/webapp`: Contains the web application resources.
  - `WEB-INF/web.xml`: The deployment descriptor file for configuring the servlets and other settings.
  - `index.jsp`: An example JSP file serving as the entry point of the web application.
- `pom.xml`: The Maven project configuration file for managing dependencies and build settings.

## Usage

To create a web application using this template, you can:

1. Create new model classes in the `com.example.model` package to represent your data and business logic.
2. Create new view classes in the `com.example.view` package to render the user interface.
3. Create new controller classes in the `com.example.controller` package to handle HTTP requests and manage the data flow between the model and view.
4. Configure the servlet mappings and other settings in the `WEB-INF/web.xml` file.
5. Implement the necessary logic and functionality based on your application requirements.
